      <h3>Directions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Making the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle
          yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and
          salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive
          oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be
          sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Making the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator 1 hour prior to
          using.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550
          degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and
          stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size
          of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon
          oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup
          crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then
          drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.
        </li>
        <li>
          With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from
          the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the
          preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left
          on the stone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off
          the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves
          randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.
        </li>
        <li>Follow Steps 5 through 9 to make the second pizza.</li>
